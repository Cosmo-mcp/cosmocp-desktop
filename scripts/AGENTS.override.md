# `scripts/` (repo tooling) — AGENTS override

This file applies to changes under `scripts/`.

## Purpose

Scripts are developer tools run from the repo root (usually via `npm run ...`).

Current scripts:
- `scripts/generate-api.ts` — regenerates `src/preload/api.ts` based on IPC controller decorators in `src/main/controllers/*`.

## Rules for scripts

- Scripts must be deterministic and idempotent:
  - Same inputs → same output file contents.
  - Do not depend on network availability unless explicitly documented and mocked for tests.
- Prefer small, focused scripts that do one job well.
- Never write outside the repo root unless explicitly requested.
- If a script generates code, the generated output should be checked into git and treated as a build artifact with a single source of truth (the generator).

## Updating IPC generation

When adding/changing IPC controllers:
- Update controllers and decorators first (`src/main/controllers/*`).
- Run `npm run generate-api`.
- If generation fails or produces incorrect imports/types, fix `scripts/generate-api.ts` rather than hand-editing `src/preload/api.ts`.
- Add a small test for the generator when changing behavior (string snapshots are acceptable).
